# mTORcascademodel
Modelling the dynamics of mTOR activation cascade. 

In most instances of tumor development, cancer cell populations develop features to respond to selection barriers, such as physical constraints or immune responses, and rapidly adapt to an always changing environment. In the present paper a particular feature is studied, the capacity of sustaining its proliferation over time. By means of Michaelis Menten dynamics, the mTOR cascade, involved in cell proliferation is studied and a model around its interactions is built. Bifurcation diagrams are analyzed in order to understand the behavior of the cascade and its in- teractions when cancer comes into play. The results show a wider aection of PTEN molecule (a tumor suppressor) on cancer than TSC (a kinase that aims to regulate mTOR activity by means of mutual inactivation).

The present repository includes the article we have written and two python notebooks with the simulations of the model.
